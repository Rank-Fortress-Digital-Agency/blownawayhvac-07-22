                            In order to find the perfect model of HVAC for your home, consider the following:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                What is the climate like in your area?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                What is the size of your home?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                How many people live in your household?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Do you have any allergies or respiratory problems?
                            </li>
                            <p>
                                The climate in your area will dictate what type of HVAC system you need. For example, if you live in an area with warm weather, you will need a different system than someone who lives in a cold climate. The size of your home is also important, as a larger home will require a more powerful system. The number of people in your household is also a factor, as more people means more heat generated. Finally, if you or anyone in your household has allergies or respiratory problems, you will need to take that into account when choosing an HVAC system.
